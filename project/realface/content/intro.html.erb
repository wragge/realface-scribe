## Introducing the Real Face of White Australia

### Our Aim

The aim of the project is to extract structured data from identification documents used in the administration of the White Australia Policy.

To divide the labor -- and to help ensure accuracy -- we've broken the work into 3 free-standing tasks. These tasks follow a sequence, but they can be performed independently (feel free to focus on the one you enjoy best).

### Task 1: Mark

Here you'll be identifying various pieces of information on the page. You won't be typing, just drawing boxes. This helps plot a route for the transcribers in Task 2. You may see existing marks left by other users. Just pick up where they left off. Often there are duplicate certificates, so it may seem you're marking the same page twice -- don't worry, you're not!

### Task 2: Transcribe

Here you'll type out the words and numbers inside the fields marked by your fellow volunteers. There may be some tricky handwriting to decipher but don't worry, each field will be transcribed multiple times to ensure accuracy. Just do the best you can and move on.

### Task 3: Verify

Every document will be transcribed several times by multiple volunteers, and our software looks for agreement among them. If a field has been transcribed consistently and independently three times, it has reached 'consensus' and is added to the final data set. If there are conflicting entries, those are queued up in the Verify task, where you can vote on the most accurate transcription, or, if needed, add your own.

### Ready?

You may find you prefer one task over another, so try them all! All tasks are essential steps in the greater effort to help us document and understand the lives of people living under the White Australia Policy!
