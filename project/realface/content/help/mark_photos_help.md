# Marking photos

Select the type of photo you're marking from the list on the right. Usually there's a front on and a side portrait. Then draw a rectangle around the corresponding photograph.

If a photo is already marked, you don't need to do it again.

Resize the rectangle if necessary by dragging the corners. Once you've finished click on the 'Done' box.
