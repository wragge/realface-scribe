# Marking

**Marking** identifies specific pieces of information on the page, such as name, age, and nationality. In most cases you'll be asked to select a field from a list and then draw a rectangle around any corresponding values. Try to get the complete handwritten entry inside the rectangle -- the contents of the box will be presented back to volunteers in the transcription phase.

If you can't find a field on the page, don't worry -- the certificates change a bit over time. If a field is already marked, you don't need to do it again. If a field is empty, don't bother drawing a rectangle.

You can mark as many or as few fields as you want. Pages will continue to be presented to volunteers for marking until it's agreed that everything has been marked.

Sometimes you'll be asked questions about what you see, such as whether there are any photos on the page. You'll also be asked to draw rectangles around things like photos, handprints, and Chinese characters.

By default, you see the marks created by other volunteers, although you can hide these if you want by toggling the switch in the left hand toolbar. You can also delete marks that you think are wrong, which counts as a vote against that mark. If enough votes are cast the mark is ignored.

For a general overview of the transcription process see the [introduction](/#/intro) page. For more detailed information see the [help](/#/help) page.
