# Marking Chinese characters

Sometimes documents are annotated with Chinese characters.

Draw a rectangle around each group of characters. Resize the rectangle if necessary by dragging the corners. Once you've finished click on the 'Done' box.

When you've marked all the characters on the page click the **Next** button.
