# Transcribing height

Please transcribe the highlighted region as accurately as you can. Don't worry about spelling or formatting, just copy what you see. If there are fractions, just transcribe each character separately. For example, &#189; would be transcribed as `1/2`

Heights often include the abbreviation `in` for inches and the qualifier `in Boots` at the end.

For example, this field

![Example of a name](/images/cd_height.png)

should be transcribed as `5 ft 3 3/4 in in Boots`.

If the highlighted region is mislabeled or misplaced, press the **Bad mark** button.

If you cannot read the text in the highlighted region, press the **Illegible** button.
