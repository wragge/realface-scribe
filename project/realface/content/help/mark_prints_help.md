# Marking hand and thumbprints

Select the type of print you're marking from the list on the right. Usually there's either a single handprint or two thumbprints. Then draw a rectangle around the corresponding print.

If a print is already marked, you don't need to do it again.

Handprints often extend beyond the bottom of the screen. In this case, draw a rectangle down as far as you can, scroll your window to view the rest of the print, and then resize the rectangle by dragging the corners until it covers the complete handprint. Once you've finished click on the 'Done' box.
