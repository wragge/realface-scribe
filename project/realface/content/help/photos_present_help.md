# Are there unmarked photos?

Many certificates include portrait photos, but not all. If there are unmarked photos on this page please select 'Yes'.

'Unmarked' means that a volunteer hasn't already drawn a blue rectangle around it.

If there are no photos, or if all the photos have already been marked, select 'No'.

Once you've made your selection click the **Next** button.
