# Marking fields

Select the field you're marking from the list on the right. Then mark the corresponding value on the page by drawing a rectangle around it.

If a field is already marked, you don't need to do it again. If a field is empty, don't bother drawing a rectangle.

Resize the rectangle if necessary by dragging the corners. Once you've finished click on the 'Done' box.

Mark as many fields on the page as you want. When you're satisfied click the **Next** button.
