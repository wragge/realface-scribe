## Helpful hints

### Tackling transcription

Accurate transcription is central to the success of our efforts in the Real Face of White Australia project. However, since we’re working with documents handwritten in the first half of the 20th century, there are some challenges in transcribing what is seen on the page. Handwriting changes from page to page, documents are damaged and aged, and there will be varying degrees of messiness in the paperwork. In addition, handwriting from the era is very different from our modern style of script. As you work with the documents more, you will get used to the variations and start to pick up on subtle differences. Not everything is going to be easily deciphered, and it is okay to not be able to interpret everything.

The files you transcribe have a number of pieces of information that will be recorded. Not only will you find numbers (height, age, document numbers, dates) and words (names, locations, ships’ names), there are also photographs, body prints (fingers or thumbs and hands) and sometimes Chinese characters. 

It is important to transcribe exactly what is written, ignoring any spelling mistakes or perceived errors in the text on the page. For example, if a date is written ‘8 Fbry 1911’, don’t correct it to read ‘8 February 1908’. However, do use your logic! For example, question whether a strangely written ‘8 ft’ might really be ‘5 ft’ in a person’s height. Try to be aware of what could be a mistake and what is just poor or lazy writing skills. Another common error is mistaking a curly capital ‘Q’ for capital ‘Z’. When in doubt, transcribe as much as you can understand, and use common sense and to fill in the blanks. All your transcriptions will be verified by others.

### Files and fields

Series ST84/1 – Certificates of Domicile and Certificates Exempting from the Dictation Test, chronological series – contains documents related to the travel of non-European people who were leaving Australia temporarily for overseas destinations. The documents are dated from 1903 to 1953. Due to long duration of this record series, the documents vary and reflect the immigration and migration policies of the time.

Non-Europeans who had a right of ‘domicile’ – that is, they met particularly residency requirements – could apply to be exempted from the Dictation Test before their departure from Australia. If successful, they were granted a Certificate of Domicile (1902–1905) or a Certificate Exempting from the Dictation Test (1906–c.1953).

#### Certificate of Domicile

A certificate of domicile is a document that proves a person's residency in a state or country. In this case, a Certificate of Domicile was used to confirm the Australian residence of a non-European person who was planning to travel outside Australia. A Certificate of Domicile would guarantee the person would not have to undertake the Dictation Test on return to Australia, providing they were properly identified. The Dictation Test was used between 1902 and 1958 as a method of refusing entry into Australia of individuals who were of non-European descent. The Dictation Test – which was administered by a Customs official reading a paragraph of text which had to be written down by the traveller – could be given in any language decided on by the Customs officer conducting the test.

A certificate of domicile can be identified by ‘CERTIFICATE OF DOMICILE’ at the top of the page. This page may also contain photographs and attached notes.

#### Certificate Exempting from the Dictation Test

A Certificate Exempting from the Dictation Test (CEDT) guaranteed that a non-European resident would not have to undertake the Dictation Test on returning to Australia, providing they were properly identified. CEDT forms replaced the Certificate of Domicile form in 1905. The Dictation Test was used between 1902 and 1958 as a method of refusing entry into Australia of individuals who were of non-European descent. The Dictation Test – which was administered by a Customs official reading a paragraph of text which had to be written down by the traveller – could be given in any language decided on by the Customs officer conducting the test.

CEDT forms can be identified by ‘CERTIFICATE EXEMPTING FROM DICTATION TEST’ at the top of the page. This page may also contain photographs and attached notes.

#### Backs of certificates

The backs of certificates can be identified by ‘IMPRESSION OF LEFT HAND’ at the top of the page or ‘THUMBPRINTS’ towards the bottom of the page. In most instances there is an impression of either the entire left hand, fingerprints or thumbprints. This page may also contain photographs and handwritten notes.

#### Landing Form (No. 32)

Landing Form (No. 32) was completed by Customs officers when a non-European person arrived in Australia. The form recorded why the person was exempted from the Immigration (Restriction) Act and details of their return. Exemptions were granted for: holders of a Certificate Exempting from the Dictation Test; naturalized citizens of Australia; people born in Australia; bona fide holders of an Exemption Certificate.

Landing Forms can be identified by ‘IMMIGRATION RESTRICTION ACTS, 1901-19XX’ at the top of the page and ‘No. 32’ in the top right corner.

#### Backs of Landing Forms

Landing Form (No. 32) was completed by Customs officers when a non-European person arrived in Australia. The person’s handprint was taken on the back of the form to enable comparison with the handprint on their Certificate of Domicile or Certificate Exempting from Dictation Test.

This page may contain an impression of the left hand and handwritten notes. There is no printed text, but text from the front of the form may be visible.
